## WIMP-Nucleon Cross-Section

This simple python code aims to calculate a constraint on the WIMP-nucleon cross-section. This is motivated by 
results from the Pierre-Auger Observatory where the detection of extragalactic ultra-high energy cosmic rays
(UCHERs) suggests cosmic rays propagating from extragalactic sources arrive at Earth without being annhilated
by possible the possible dark matter candidate WIMPs.
